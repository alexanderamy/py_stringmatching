Evaluation of a pragmatic approach for the prediction of radiation-induced losses in optical fibers  
The Vortex is a marriage of the best features of two rear screen technologies - optical and diffusion. A .5mm Fresnel lens gathers the light from the projector and directs it at a right angle through the screen. As the light exits the screen on the audience side a diffusion medium redistributes the light evenly in all directions - up down left right and center giving an exceptionally wide viewing cone in both the horizontal and vertical axes. An extraordinary center-to-corner brightness ratio gives a uniform brightness witout hot spots. Vortex Features -Vortex is designed to be used with single lens projectors -Projected light is collimated then diffused evenly making the Vortex well suited for use in videowalls and rooms with tiered seating patterns -Charcoal grey tint provides superior color contrast even under harsh ambient light -Diffusion medium is in the acrylic so it can t be scratched or damaged -Warranted for one year against defects in materials and workmanship  Installation Instructions
